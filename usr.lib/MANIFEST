Notes
-----
libm/		We haven't made any effort to convert the new math library for
		the PDP-11 yet (if it's even possible).  If anyone does it for
		us, PLEASE #ifdef your changes on "pdp11".  A PDP support
		subdirectory would be nice too ...  In any case, till that
		happens (sic), 2.10BSD uses libom and hides that fact from
		applications by linking libm.a to libom.a in /usr/lib.

The directories PORT and OLD are somewhat special.  PORT is the source
code from the 4.3 distribution that should probably be ported to 2.10
as soon as someone has the time and inclination to do so.  OLD is the
source code from the 2.9 CSS distribution that worked (well, mostly worked?)
with the original 2.9.  It should be especially noted as the repository
of the original FORTRAN libraries.  The new ones have not been tested,
although they should work.

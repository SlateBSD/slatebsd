This file and the directories cvt and uucp have been stolen directly from
the 4.3BSD distibution.  They are as is and untested.

The rest of the directories (doc, man, misc, and src) comprise the 2.11NEWS
system as distributed on mod.sources in September of 1986.  They have been
compiled and run on a 2.10BSD system and work with the exception of expire
and vnews which tend to die from memory starvation.  You can live without
vnews obviously, but we haven't been able to find anyone willing to rewrite
expire more portably, so your best bet, when it starts to die when the
history files grows too large, is to start using find and rm ...  This is
obviously not very satifactory, so you're welcome to rewrite expire for
2.10BSD.  And no, setting the expiration time limit down doesn't seem to
solve the problem.

-----<2.10.3NEWS, 4.3BSD distribution release README>-----

Warning: The compression scheme provided here is not compatible with the
2.10.2 version. You must get all the sites you communicate with to run
this version of unbatch.c. Otherwise, your compressed news will
be thrown away. On the otherhand, you no longer need to have cunbatch
on the remote system.

Compress V4.0 is provided with this release. It is not compatible with
the 2.0 compress, however, if the -C flag is given to sendbatch, compress
will generate V2.0 output. This program can decompress either format 
automatically.

Note that sendbatch -c  has replaced csendbatch. sendbatch now takes
several flags. See the man page for details.

Disclaimer:

This release (2.10.3 4.3bsd) is for the 4.3bsd tape. The code is known
to work on 4.[123]bsd vaxes. It seems works on USG  & V7 systems but has not
been extensively tested. There are certainly problems on Eunice systems.
DO NOT use this with VMS defined, you will regret it.

In any case, please mail me any problems you have.

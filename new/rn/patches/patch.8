System: rn version 4.3
Patch #: 8
Priority: MEDIUM
Subject: default doesn't work in normal vs mailbox question
>From: lwall@sdcrdcf.UUCP (Larry Wall)

Description:
	Through a mental short circuit on the part of the author, the
	default mechanism was munched on the question you are asked
	when saving an article regarding whether you want it to be a
	mailbox or a normal file.

Repeat-By:
	Save a file to a new name.  When it asks what kind of file you want
	to create, type space.  It will get mad at you.

Fix:	From rn, say "| patch -d DIR", where DIR is your rn source directory.
	Outside of rn, say "cd DIR; patch <thisarticle".  If you don't have
	the patch program, apply the following by hand, or get patch.

	If patch indicates that patchlevel is the wrong version, you may need
	to apply one or more previous patches, or the patch may already
	have been applied.  See the patchlevel file to find out what has or
	has not been applied.  In any event, don't continue with the patch.

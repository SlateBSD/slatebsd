System: rn version 4.3
Patch #: 15
Priority: LOW
Subject: shouldn't have included sys/types.h twice
>From: 5432dh@homxb.UUCP (David Himber)

Description:
	A previous patch made ndir.c include sys/types.h.  Unfortunately,
	common.h already includes it, and this gives some compilers
	indigestion.  I guess our compiler is too forgiving.

Fix:	From rn, say "| patch -d DIR", where DIR is your rn source directory.
	Outside of rn, say "cd DIR; patch <thisarticle".  If you don't have
	the patch program, apply the following by hand, or get patch.

	If patch indicates that patchlevel is the wrong version, you may need
	to apply one or more previous patches, or the patch may already
	have been applied.  See the patchlevel file to find out what has or
	has not been applied.  In any event, don't continue with the patch.

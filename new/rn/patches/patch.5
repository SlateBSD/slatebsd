System: rn version 4.3
Patch #: 5
Priority: LOW
Subject: after exiting newsgroup with 'Q', space won't reenter newsgroup
>From: lwall@sdcrdcf.UUCP (Larry Wall)

Description:
	When you exit a newsgroup with 'Q', which leaves you in the same
	newsgroup at the newsgroup selection level, the default command
	remains 'n' or '^N', despite what the prompt says.  Typing space
	then does not have the expected result.

Fix:	From rn, say "| patch -d DIR", where DIR is your rn source directory.
	Outside of rn, say "cd DIR; patch <thisarticle".  If you don't have
	the patch program, apply the following by hand, or get patch.

	Warning: this patch is not reversed.  If the patch program says
	it is, then this patch has already been applied, and you should
	not apply it again.

	If patch indicates that patchlevel is the wrong version, you may need
	to apply one or more previous patches, or the patch may already
	have been applied.  See the patchlevel file to find out what has or
	has not been applied.  In any event, don't continue with the patch.
